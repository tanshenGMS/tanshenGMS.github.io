  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Super Armored League</strong> is a free-to-download single-player game independently developed and provided by me. Players participate in competitive matches between two AI-driven teams.</p>
  <p>I highly value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle and use your information when you use this application. It is intended to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK GDPR, and other relevant laws in the regions where I operate or where the application is accessible.</p>

  <h2>1. Personal Information Not Directly Collected</h2>
  <p>This application is a single-player game that does not require you to register an account, enter your real name, age, email address, phone number, mailing address, or any other personally identifiable information directly linked to your real identity.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
  <p>When you use this application, the integrated third-party service Google AdMob SDK may automatically collect certain non-personal information or information that may be considered personal data in some regions, for purposes such as improving ad performance, analytics, and fraud prevention. The collection and use of such data strictly comply with platform-specific requirements and your consent preferences.</p>

  <p><strong>For Android devices:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> The device’s IP address is collected (providing an approximate location with an accuracy equal to or greater than 3 km², such as the city where the user is located, or location data available via Android’s ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission). This is primarily used for estimating device location, ad targeting, and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interaction Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the application, such as app launches, clicks, and video views, which can be used to improve ad performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic Information:</strong> Data related to the app and SDK performance, including crash logs, app startup times, ANR (app not responding) rates, and battery consumption, which may also be used for advertising and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> The Android Advertising ID (AAID) and App Set ID are collected for purposes such as ad delivery, frequency capping, conversion tracking, and ad personalization.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> Information such as the ads you have viewed, to support analytics and ad functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Information such as app startup times, ANR rates, or battery usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, assess existing features, plan new features, and deliver ads (including sharing with other entities involved in ad display).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>For iOS devices:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising Identifier (IDFA):</strong> Collected and used with your permission for ad delivery, frequency capping, conversion tracking, and ad personalization. You may manage tracking preferences through your iOS device settings or the in-app privacy settings.</li>
    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Collected to estimate the device’s approximate location (e.g., city-level), mainly for ad targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interaction Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, such as app launches, clicks, and video views.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic Information:</strong> Includes crash logs, app startup times, ANR rates, and battery usage, which may also be used for advertising and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Data such as app startup times, ANR rates, or battery consumption, used for evaluating user behavior, understanding feature performance, planning new features, and delivering ads (including sharing with other entities involved in ad display).</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> Information on ads you have viewed, used to support analytics and ad functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Even if you opt out of personalized ads, ad platforms may still use certain device information (such as IP address, device type, or coarse location) to display non-personalized ads in order to maintain basic ad delivery functionality.</p>

  <p>All data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted during transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The collection of such information is based on your consent preferences and is entirely managed and processed by the third-party service in accordance with its own privacy policy. I comply strictly with the advertising identifier usage rules set by Google Play and the Apple App Store and respect your privacy choices.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Their Privacy Policies</h2>
  <p>To provide advertising and in-app purchase features, the application integrates the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob automatically collects the data described in Section 2 to display ads (including personalized, non-personalized, and rewarded ads). This data is shared with Google, which uses it in accordance with its own privacy policy. I strongly recommend reviewing Google’s privacy policy to understand how it handles your information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
    <li><strong>Unity In-App Purchasing (Unity IAP):</strong> Integrated to enable in-app purchases through Google Play and the App Store. When you make a purchase, the result is stored locally to determine whether the corresponding entitlement should be activated. No information that may be considered personal is stored or voluntarily shared with any third parties other than Unity, Google, or Apple. Unity Analytics is not enabled in this application, so no user data is collected or analyzed through Unity Analytics. For more information, see Unity’s privacy policy: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Ad Content</h2>
  <p>This application contains the following types of ads:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interstitial Ads</li>
    <li>Rewarded Ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ad content is managed by the Google AdMob platform based on your consent preferences. For users in regions subject to certain data protection regulations (such as the EEA and UK), the game provides a dedicated privacy settings button in-game to enable privacy preference adjustments whenever there is an active internet connection.</p>

  <h2>5. How I Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Information collected automatically via third-party services is used mainly for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Providing in-app advertising services: This includes loading and displaying interstitial and rewarded ads, and enabling in-game rewards for watching rewarded ads. If consent is granted, ads may be personalized based on your device information, IP address, usage data, and other signals.</li>
    <li>Analyzing ad performance: Understanding ad display effectiveness and user interaction.</li>
    <li>Preventing fraud and abuse: Detecting and preventing invalid ad traffic or fraudulent activity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Legal Bases for Processing Your Information (EEA & UK Users Only)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK, the legal basis for processing your personal data depends on the specific activity and purpose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Especially for personalized advertising, I rely on your explicit consent to process your data. You can withdraw this consent at any time via the in-game privacy settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For displaying non-personalized ads, conducting basic ad analytics, and preventing fraud, which are necessary for providing the free game service and are balanced against your rights and freedoms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the application is launched for the first time in the EEA or UK, Google’s UMP SDK will display a Consent Management Platform (CMP) interface to request your authorization for personalized ads and related data usage. You can also adjust your consent preferences in the game settings at any time.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>With your authorization, I will share your personal information only with Google AdMob for the purpose of personalized ad delivery, as described in Section 2. I will not share your personal data with any other third parties except in the case of a business transfer or as required by law (see Section 13).</p>

  <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are an EEA or UK user), you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to processing, data portability, and withdrawing consent.</p>
  <p>Since this application does not directly collect or store personally identifiable information and does not have a user account system, my ability to exercise these rights on your behalf is very limited. If you wish to exercise rights related to data collected via third-party services (such as Google AdMob), you will generally need to contact those providers directly. Please review the privacy policies of these providers (see Section 3) to understand their mechanisms for exercising your rights. I will provide assistance within the limits of applicable law.</p>

  <h2>9. Protection of Minors</h2>
  <p>This application features a retro, nostalgic animation style and is not intended for minors.</p>
  <p>According to store questionnaires, the content rating on Google Play is 16+. However, I have manually set the download restriction on Google Play to adults aged 18 and above. Therefore, although the content rating on Google Play is 16+, the download access is restricted to adults (18+). Additionally, if Google determines a user is underage, access to the application will be restricted accordingly.</p>
  <p>This means the application is not directed at any underage users and does not actively collect or process any personal information from minors. Reasonable measures have been taken to protect the privacy of minors, and the restrictions of this application have been developed with reference to applicable regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
  <p>Since this application has taken all reasonable steps to avoid obtaining or determining users’ age, it is therefore unable to directly identify or verify a user’s age. If parents discover that their underage child may have downloaded and used this application, they may take action through the relevant mechanisms provided by the App Store or Google Play. Within the limits of applicable law and my capabilities, I will provide necessary assistance and guidance.</p>

  <h2>10. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>This application does not actively store or sync any personally identifiable information, nor does it provide account systems or cloud storage. All data related to ad display and analytics is handled and managed by the third-party SDKs listed in Section 3. I have no access to the raw personal data stored independently by these third parties. Reasonable measures will be taken to protect any information under my direct control.</p>

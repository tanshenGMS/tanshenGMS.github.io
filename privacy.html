  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 16, 2025</p>

  <p><em>Super Armored League</em> is a free-to-play, offline, single-player game developed and provided by me personally. In this game, players participate in AI-driven competitive battles between two factions.</p>

  <p>I value your privacy highly. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle and use your information when you use this application.</p>

  <p>This policy is intended to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK GDPR, and other relevant laws in jurisdictions where this app is accessible.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. No Direct Collection of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>This app is a standalone offline game that does not require user registration. You are not asked to provide your real name, email address, phone number, mailing address, or any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not collect any personal information that can directly identify you.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
  <p>While you use this app, third-party services integrated into the app, specifically Google AdMob SDK, may automatically collect certain types of non-personal information (or information considered personal under certain jurisdictions) to improve ad performance, analytics, and fraud prevention. Collection and usage of this data are subject to your authorization and the platform-specific requirements:</p>

  <h3>For Android Devices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used to estimate the approximate device location (at least a 3 sq. km area, e.g., city-level), for ad targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interactions:</strong> Includes app launches, taps, and video views for ad performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic Information:</strong> Such as crash logs, app launch time, ANRs, and battery usage, useful for ad analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Includes the Android Advertising ID (AAID) and app set ID for frequency capping, conversion tracking, and personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> For example, which ads were viewed, used to support ad features.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> App behavior like launch times and battery usage, possibly shared with ad partners.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For iOS Devices:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising Identifier (IDFA):</strong> Collected only with your permission. Used for ad targeting, conversion tracking, and personalization.</li>
    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> For approximate location and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interactions:</strong> Includes app launches, taps, and video views for ad performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic and Performance Data:</strong> Such as crash logs, app launch time, ANRs, and battery usage, useful for ad analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> For example, which ads were viewed, used to support ad features.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Even if you opt out of personalized ads, some device data (e.g., IP address, general location) may still be used to serve non-personalized ads to ensure basic ad functionality.</p>

  <p>All data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using TLS and processed per your consent and Google’s privacy policies.</p>

  <p>I comply with Google Play and Apple App Store requirements regarding ad identifiers and respect your privacy preferences.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Their Privacy Policies</h2>
  <p>To provide advertising services, the app integrates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Collects and processes the data listed in Section 2 to serve ads (personalized or non-personalized, including rewarded ads). This data is shared with and handled by Google according to its privacy policy. Please review Google’s privacy policy to learn more:<br/>
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Ad Content</h2>
  <p>This app includes the following types of ads:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interstitial Ads</li>
    <li>Rewarded Ads</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ad content is managed by Google AdMob based on your consent preferences. You may adjust these preferences at any time via the in-game privacy settings.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. How I Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ad Serving:</strong> To load and display interstitial and rewarded ads, and grant in-game rewards after viewing.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Performance Analytics:</strong> To measure ad engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> To detect and prevent invalid traffic or abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Legal Basis for Data Processing (EEA and UK Only)</h2>
  <p>If you’re located in the EEA or UK, the legal basis for processing your data via AdMob includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Required for personalized ads. You can revoke consent at any time in the game’s privacy settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For non-personalized ads, basic analytics, and fraud prevention—necessary to support free services without infringing on your rights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon first launch in EEA or UK, a consent dialog (via Google UMP SDK) will be shown. Consent preferences can be changed anytime in settings.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>With your consent, only Google AdMob will receive and process your personal data for personalized advertising. No other third parties will receive your information unless required by law or in the event of a business transfer (see Section 13).</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are in the EEA or UK), you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correct, delete your data</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to data processing</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    <li>Request data portability</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since this app does not collect personal identity data or use account systems, I cannot directly fulfill such requests. For data handled by Google AdMob, please refer to their privacy policy and contact mechanisms to exercise your rights. I will assist where legally required and technically feasible.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is general-audience and suitable for all ages but is not intended for children under 13 (or the age defined by your region’s law).</p>
  <p>On first launch, the app prompts users to confirm if they are 18 or older <strong>(e.g., by selecting ✔ for yes, or ✘ for no)</strong>. This choice only affects whether personalized ads are shown and is not stored. If a user selects ✘, no personalized ads will be displayed, and the user is treated as a minor under compliance regulations.</p>
  <p>I have marked this app as “Not directed to children under 13” in Google AdMob and taken steps to comply with COPPA and similar laws. No knowingly collected or processed data from children under 13 is retained.</p>
  <p>If a parent believes their child’s personal information may have been collected, they should contact the relevant third-party service (e.g., Google AdMob) using the channels in its privacy policy. I will provide guidance and assistance as allowed by applicable law.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>10. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>This app does not store or sync any personally identifiable data. There are no accounts or cloud saves. All analytics and ad-related data are handled by the third-party SDKs listed in Section 3. I do not have access to the raw personal data collected by third parties. I take reasonable measures to protect the information under my direct control.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data collected and processed by Google AdMob (such as IP address, ad interactions, device data) is retained for a period necessary to provide, maintain, and improve ad services, detect fraud, and comply with legal obligations. Retention periods vary by data type and purpose and follow Google’s own policies. Please refer to Google’s privacy policy for details (see Section 3).</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>12. App Permissions</h2>
  <p>To provide ad functionality and basic app features, the app may request:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Network Access Permission:</strong> To load ads and validate services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All permission requests follow OS-level standards and require user approval. Permissions are not used for any non-essential purposes. The app does not run in the background or track your behavior or location without authorization.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>13. Business Transfers</h2>
  <p>If the project is subject to a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, your personal data may be transferred as part of that process. I will strive to ensure the new entity honors this Privacy Policy or provides you with a new one.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated due to changes in features, third-party services, or legal requirements. Updated versions will be posted on this page. I recommend checking this page periodically.</p>

  <hr />

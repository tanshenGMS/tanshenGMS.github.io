    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> Junie 21, 2025</p>

    <p>"Victory! SteelSquad" is a free-to-download, single-player offline game developed and provided by me, where players participate in competitive matches between two AI-driven factions.</p>

    <p>I attach great importance to user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle and use your information when you use this application.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy aims to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> in the European Economic Area (EEA), the <strong>UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)</strong>, and other relevant laws in regions where I operate or where this application is accessible.</p>

    

    <h2>1. Personal Information Not Directly Collected</h2>
    <p>This application is an offline, standalone game that does not require account registration. It does not ask you to create a user account, nor does it require you to input your real name, email address, phone number, mailing address, or other personally identifiable information. It also does not collect personal information directly linked to your real identity.</p>

    

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>When you use this application, the integrated third-party service, <strong>Google AdMob SDK</strong>, may automatically collect the following non-personal information, or information considered personal information in certain regions, for the purposes of improving ad performance, analytics, and fraud prevention. The collection and use of this data strictly adhere to the following platform-specific requirements and your authorization:</p>

    <h3>For Android Devices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Collects the device's IP address (the user's or device's approximate location, covering an area greater than or equal to 3 square kilometers, such as the user's city or a location that Android's <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> permission might provide). This information is primarily used to estimate the device's general location for ad targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interaction with Products:</strong> Collects information about user interactions with products, including app launches, clicks, and video views. This interaction information can be used to improve ad performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Information:</strong> Collects information related to the performance of the app and the SDK, including crash logs, app launch times, hang rates, and power consumption. This diagnostic information can also be used for advertising and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Collects the device's <strong>Android Advertising ID (AAID)</strong> and <strong>App Set ID</strong>. These identifiers are used for ad serving, frequency capping, conversion tracking, and ad personalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> For example, ads viewed by the user, which supports analytics and advertising features.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Collects user-related performance data, such as app launch times, hang rates, or power consumption, which can be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For iOS Devices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA):</strong> With your authorization, collects and uses the device's <strong>Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)</strong>. This identifier is used for ad serving, frequency capping, conversion tracking, and ad personalization. Users can manage their tracking preferences through iOS device settings or in-app privacy settings.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Collects the device's IP address, used to estimate the device's approximate location (e.g., the user's city), primarily for ad targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interaction with Products:</strong> Collects information about user interactions with products, including app launches, clicks, and video views. This interaction information can be used to improve ad performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic Information:</strong> Collects information related to the performance of the app and the SDK, including crash logs, app launch times, hang rates, and power consumption. This diagnostic information can also be used for advertising and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Collects user-related performance data, such as app launch times, hang rates, or power consumption, which can be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> For example, ads viewed by the user, which supports analytics and advertising features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if you choose not to receive personalized ads, ad platforms may still use some device information (such as IP address, device type, rough geo-location, etc.) to display non-personalized ads unrelated to you, in order to ensure the basic functionality of ad display.</p>
    <p>All user data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted during transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The collection of this information follows user authorization preferences and is entirely managed and processed by third-party services in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>
    <p>I strictly comply with the terms regarding the use of advertising identifiers set by relevant platforms (Google Play and Apple App Store) and respect your privacy choices.</p>

    

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Their Privacy Policies</h2>
    <p>To provide advertising services in this application, I integrate the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob automatically collects the data described in Section 2 of this policy to display ads to you (including personalized and non-personalized ads, as well as rewarded ads). This data is shared with Google. Google will use this data according to its own privacy policy. I strongly recommend that you review Google's privacy policy to understand how Google handles your information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
        <li><strong>Unity In-App Purchasing (Unity IAP):</strong> This application integrates Unity IAP to support in-app purchases via Google Play and the App Store. When users make a purchase, the result is only stored locally to determine entitlement activation. No information that may be considered personal or private is stored or actively shared with any third parties other than Unity, Google, or Apple. Unity Analytics is not enabled in this application, so no user data is collected or analyzed.You can review Unity's privacy policy here:<a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    
    
    <h2>4. Ad Content Description</h2>
    <p>This application contains the following types of ads:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interstitial Ads</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Rewarded Ads</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ad content is managed by the Google AdMob platform based on user-authorized preferences. For users in regions subject to specific data protection regulations (e.g., the European Economic Area and the UK), privacy preferences can be enabled at any time via a dedicated in-game privacy settings button, provided the app has an active network connection.</p>

    

    <h2>5. How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>I use the information automatically collected through third-party services primarily for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide in-app advertising services:</strong> Including loading and displaying interstitial and rewarded ads, and enabling the function of watching rewarded ads to obtain in-game rewards; if your consent is obtained, personalized recommended ads that better align with your preferences and interests may also be provided based on your device information, IP address, usage data, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze ad performance:</strong> Understand the effectiveness of ad displays and user interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent fraud and inappropriate activities:</strong> Detect and block invalid ad traffic or fraudulent behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing Your Information (Applicable only to EEA and UK Users)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), the legal basis for processing your personal information depends on the related processing activity and its purpose. For data processed by AdMob for advertising purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Based on Your Consent:</strong> Especially when it comes to personalized advertising, I rely on your explicit consent to process your data. You can withdraw your consent through the in-game privacy settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Based on My Legitimate Interests:</strong> For example, to display non-personalized ads, perform basic ad performance analysis, and prevent fraud, which are necessary for me to provide free game services, and I believe these interests are legitimate while fully safeguarding your rights and freedoms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the application is launched for the first time within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), Google's User Messaging Platform SDK (UMP SDK) will display a Consent Management Platform (CMP) interface to obtain your authorization for personalized ads and related data usage. You can also modify your consent preferences at any time in the game settings.</p>

    

    <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>With your authorization, as described in Section 2 of this policy, I will only share your personal information with the third-party Google AdMob for personalized ad delivery. I will not share your personal information with any other third party beyond Google (AdMob), except in cases of business transfer or legal requirements (see Section 13).</p>

    

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are an EEA or UK user), you may have specific rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include: access, rectification, erasure of your personal data; restriction or objection to my processing of your data; data portability; and withdrawal of consent, etc.</p>
    <p>Since this application does not directly collect and store your personally identifiable information and does not have a user account system, my ability to directly provide you with these rights is very limited. If you wish to exercise rights related to data collected through third-party services (such as Google AdMob), you will usually need to contact the relevant third-party service provider directly to process your data or exercise your rights. I recommend that you review the privacy policies of third-party service providers (e.g., Google AdMob, see the link provided in Section 3) to understand the mechanisms and contact information they provide for exercising data rights. I will assist you in exercising your rights to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

    

    <h2>9. Protection of Minors</h2>
    <p>This application features a retro, nostalgic animation style and is not intended for minors.</p>
    <p>According to store questionnaires, the content rating on Google Play is 16+. However, I have manually set the download restriction on Google Play to adults aged 18 and above. Therefore, although the content rating on Google Play is 16+, the download access is restricted to adults (18+). Additionally, if Google determines a user is underage, access to the application will be restricted accordingly.</p>
    <p>This means the application is not directed at any underage users and does not actively collect or process any personal information from minors. Reasonable measures have been taken to protect the privacy of minors, and the restrictions of this application have been developed with reference to applicable regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
    <p>Since this application has taken all reasonable steps to avoid obtaining or determining users’ age, it is therefore unable to directly identify or verify a user’s age. If parents discover that their underage child may have downloaded and used this application, they may take action through the relevant mechanisms provided by the App Store or Google Play. Within the limits of applicable law and my capabilities, I will provide necessary assistance and guidance.</p>


    

    <h2>10. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>This application does not actively store or synchronize any user's personally identifiable data, nor does it provide account systems, cloud storage, or similar functions. All data related to ad display and associated statistical analysis is performed and managed by the third-party SDKs listed in Section 3 of this policy. I myself cannot access the raw personal data content independently stored by third parties. I will take reasonable security measures to protect information within my direct control.</p>

    

    <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I collect and process your personal information (including device information, IP address, ad interaction information, and other usage data) through third-party services (Google AdMob) as described in Section 2 of this policy. This data is retained for a period of time to provide, maintain, and improve advertising services, analyze ad performance, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations. The specific retention period for data depends on the data type and processing purpose, and follows the data retention policies of the relevant third-party service provider (Google). For more detailed information on how Google retains data, please consult Google's privacy policy (see the link provided in Section 3 of this policy) and the specific data retention policies for its related products.</p>

    

    <h2>12. App Permissions Explanation</h2>
    <p>To ensure the operation of advertising services and basic functions, this application may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Access:</strong> Used for loading ads and verifying services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permission requests will follow the standard operating system procedures and require user authorization, and will not be used for purposes unrelated to the game's core functionality.</p>
    <p>This application does not continuously run in the background and will not track your behavior or location without authorization.</p>

    

    <h2>13. Business Transfer</h2>
    <p>In the event of a business transfer such as a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transferred assets. I will endeavor to ensure that the new entity continues to protect and process your personal information in accordance with this policy or by providing you with a new privacy policy.</p>

    

    <h2>14. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may revise this policy based on product feature updates, changes in third-party services used, or adjustments to laws and regulations. The revised version will become effective upon its posting on this page. I recommend that users regularly review this page for the latest changes.</p>

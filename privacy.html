    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong>  May 16, 2025</p>

    <p>"Super Armored League" is a free, single-player offline game developed and provided by us, where players participate in competitive matches between two AI-driven factions.</p>
    <p>We attach great importance to user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and use your information when you use this application.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK GDPR in the United Kingdom, and other relevant laws in the areas where we operate or where this application is accessible.</p>

    <h2>1. Personal Information We Do Not Directly Collect</h2>
    <p>This application is an "open-and-play" offline single-player game. We do not require you to create a user account, nor do we require you to enter personal identification information such as your real name, email address, phone number, mailing address, etc. We do not collect personal information directly linked to your real identity.</p>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>When you use this application, the third-party services we integrate may automatically collect the following non-personal information or information considered personal information in certain regions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Includes device type, operating system version, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used to determine your approximate geographic location (country or city level), primarily for ad targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Interaction Information:</strong> Includes ad views, click behavior, and other usage data related to ad display.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The collection of this information follows user authorization preferences and is entirely managed and processed by third-party services in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Their Privacy Policies</h2>
    <p>To provide advertising display services in this application, we have integrated the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob automatically collects the data described in Section 2 of this policy to show you advertisements (including personalized and non-personalized ads, as well as rewarded ads). This data is shared with Google. Google will use this data according to its own privacy policy. We strongly recommend that you review Google's privacy policy to understand how Google handles your information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Ad Content Description</h2>
    <p>This application contains the following types of advertisements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interstitial Ads</li>
        <li>Rewarded Ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ad content is managed by the Google AdMob platform based on user authorization preferences. Users can adjust whether to allow data for personalized advertising to be provided to third parties at any time on the in-game privacy settings page.</p>

    <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We primarily use the personal information automatically collected through third-party services for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Providing in-app advertising services:</strong> Including loading and displaying interstitial and rewarded ads, and implementing the function of watching rewarded ads to obtain in-game rewards. If we obtain your consent, we may also provide personalized recommended ads that are more in line with your preferences and interests based on your device information, IP address, usage data, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyzing ad performance:</strong> To understand the effectiveness of ad displays and user interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Preventing fraud and improper activities:</strong> Detecting and blocking invalid ad traffic or fraudulent behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing Your Information (Applies only to EEA and UK Users)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), the legal basis for processing your personal information depends on the relevant processing activity and its purpose. For data processed by AdMob for advertising purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Based on your Consent:</strong> Especially when it comes to personalized advertising, we rely on your explicit consent to process your data. You can withdraw your consent through the in-game privacy settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Based on our Legitimate Interests:</strong> For example, displaying non-personalized ads, conducting basic ad performance analysis, and preventing fraud are necessary for us to provide free game services, and we believe these interests are legitimate under the premise of fully safeguarding your rights and freedoms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will share your personal information described in Section 2 of this policy with third parties (Google AdMob) for advertising purposes. We will not sell your personal information to parties other than Google (AdMob), except in the case of a business transfer (see below) or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are an EEA or UK user), you may have specific rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include: accessing, correcting, and deleting your personal data; restricting or objecting to our processing of your data; data portability; withdrawing consent, etc.</p>
    <p>Since this application does not directly collect and store your personal identification information and has no user account system, our ability to directly provide you with these rights is very limited. If you wish to exercise rights related to data collected through third-party services (such as Google AdMob), you usually need to contact the corresponding third-party service provider directly to handle your data or exercise your rights. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of the third-party service provider (e.g., Google AdMob, see the link provided in Section 3) to understand the data rights exercise mechanisms and contact information they provide. We will provide assistance for the exercise of your rights to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This application is a game for the general public, with content suitable for all ages, but it is not specifically targeted at or directed towards child users under 13 years old (or other ages specified by the laws of your country/region). We do not knowingly collect personal identification information directly from children under 13 years old.</p>
    <p>This application automatically collects technical data through third-party services (Google AdMob). We have marked this application as "not directed to children under 13" in the Google AdMob platform and have taken steps to ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) at our service level, for example, by not knowingly collecting or processing personal information from children under 13 years old through this application, or using it in ways that violate children's privacy regulations.</p>
    <p>If parents find that the personal information of their children under 13 years old may have been collected by third-party services through this application and wish to delete or stop the collection of this information, please contact the corresponding third-party service provider directly (e.g., Google AdMob, you can find the contact information or mechanisms provided in their privacy policy) to handle the relevant data or exercise data rights. We will provide assistance and information guidance within our capabilities in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>This application does not actively store or synchronize any user's personal identification data, nor does it provide account systems, cloud storage, or other functions. All data related to ad display and relevant statistical analysis is executed and managed by the third-party SDK listed in Section 3 of this policy. We ourselves cannot access the original personal data content independently stored by third parties. We will take reasonable security measures to protect information within our direct control.</p>

    <h2>11. Application Permissions Description</h2>
    <p>To ensure the operation of advertising services and basic functions, this application may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network access permission:</strong> Used to load advertisements and verify services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permission requests will follow the standard operating system process and require user authorization, and will not be used for purposes unrelated to the core functions of the game.</p>

    <h2>12. Business Transfer</h2>
    <p>If [Developer Name] undergoes a business transfer such as a merger, acquisition, asset sale, bankruptcy, or reorganization, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transferred assets to the new entity in accordance with legal provisions.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this policy based on product feature updates, changes in integrated third-party services, or adjustments to laws and regulations. The revised version will become effective upon publication on this page. We recommend that users regularly check this page for the latest changes.</p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 16, 2025</p>

    <p>"Super Armored League" is a free single-player offline game developed and provided by me, where players participate in competitive matches between two AI-driven factions.</p>
    <p>I highly value user privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and use your information when you use this application.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), and other relevant laws in the regions where I operate or this application is accessible.</p>

    <h2>1. Personal Information I Do Not Directly Collect</h2>
    <p>This application is an "instant play" offline single-player game. I do not require you to create a user account, nor do I require you to enter personal identity information such as your real name, email address, phone number, mailing address, etc. I also do not collect personal information directly linked to your real identity.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>When you use this application, third-party services integrated by me may automatically collect the following information, which is non-personal or may be considered personal information in certain regions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Including device type, operating system version, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used to determine your approximate geographical location (country or city level), primarily for advertising targeting and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Interaction Information:</strong> Including ad views, click behavior, and other usage data related to ad display.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The collection of this information follows your authorization preferences and is entirely managed and processed by third-party services in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Their Privacy Policies</h2>
    <p>To provide in-app advertising services in this application, I have integrated the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob automatically collects the data described in Section 2 of this policy to show you ads (including personalized ads, non-personalized ads, and rewarded ads). This data will be shared with Google. Google will use this data in accordance with its own privacy policy. I strongly recommend that you review Google's privacy policy to understand how Google handles your information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Ad Content Description</h2>
    <p>This application contains the following types of ads:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Interstitial Ads</li>
        <li>Rewarded Ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ad content is managed by the Google AdMob platform based on user authorization preferences. Users can adjust whether to allow third parties to provide data for personalized advertising at any time in the in-game privacy settings page.</p>

    <h2>5. How I Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>I use the personal information collected automatically through third-party services, primarily for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing in-app advertising services: Including loading and displaying interstitial and rewarded ads, and enabling the function of watching rewarded ads to receive in-game rewards; if I obtain your consent, I may also provide personalized recommended ads that better match your preferences and interests based on your device information, IP address, usage data, etc.</li>
        <li>Analyzing ad performance: Understanding the effectiveness of ad displays and user interactions.</li>
        <li>Preventing fraud and improper activities: Detecting and blocking invalid ad traffic or fraudulent behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing Your Information (For EEA and UK Users Only)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), my legal basis for processing your personal information depends on the relevant processing activity and its purpose. For processing data for advertising purposes through AdMob:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Based on Your Consent:</strong> Particularly when it comes to personalized advertising, I rely on your explicit consent to process your data. You can withdraw your consent through the in-game privacy settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Based on My Legitimate Interests:</strong> For example, displaying non-personalized ads, performing basic ad performance analysis, and preventing fraud are necessary for me to provide a free game service, and I believe these interests are legitimate provided your rights and freedoms are fully protected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Subject to your authorization, I will, as described in Section 2 of this policy, only share Your Personal Data with the third party Google AdMob for the purpose of personalized advertising. I will not share Your Personal Data with any other third party outside of Google (AdMob), unless in the case of a business transfer or as required by law (see Section 13).</p>

    <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (especially if you are an EEA or UK user), you may have specific rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include: accessing, rectifying, or erasing Your Personal Data; restricting or objecting to my processing of your data; data portability; withdrawing consent, etc.</p>
    <p>As this application does not directly collect and store your personal identity information and has no user account system, my ability to directly provide you with these rights is very limited. If you wish to exercise rights related to data collected through third-party services (such as Google AdMob), you will typically need to contact the respective third-party service provider directly to process your data or exercise your rights. I recommend that you review the privacy policies of third-party service providers (e.g., Google AdMob, see the link provided in Section 3) to understand the data rights exercise mechanisms and contact information they provide. I will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, provide assistance for the exercise of your rights.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This application is a general audience game suitable for all age groups but is not specifically directed at or intended for child users under the age of 13 (or other age defined by law in your country/region). I do not knowingly collect personal identity information directly from children under 13.</p>
    <p>This application automatically collects technical data through third-party services (Google AdMob). I have marked this application as "not directed to children under 13" on the Google AdMob platform and have taken steps to ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) at my service level, for example, by not knowingly collecting or processing personal information from children under 13 through this application, or using it in ways that violate children's privacy regulations.</p>
    <p>If a parent discovers that the personal information of their child under 13 may have been collected by a third-party service through this application and wishes to have this information deleted or stop its collection, please contact the respective third-party service provider directly (e.g., Google AdMob, through the contact information or mechanism provided in their privacy policy) to process the relevant data or exercise data rights. I will, in accordance with applicable law and within my capabilities, provide assistance and information guidance.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>This application does not actively store or synchronize any user's personal identity data, nor does it provide account systems, cloud storage, or similar features. All data related to ad display and associated statistical analysis is performed and managed by the third-party SDKs listed in Section 3 of this policy. I do not have access to the original personal data content independently stored by third parties. I will take reasonable security measures to protect information within my direct control.</p>

    <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I collect and process Your Personal Data (including device information, IP address, ad interaction information, and other usage data) through third-party services (Google AdMob) as described in Section 2 of this policy. This data is retained for a period of time to provide, maintain, and improve advertising services, analyze ad performance, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations.</p>
    <p>The specific data retention periods depend on the type of data and the purpose of processing, and follow the data retention policies of the relevant third-party service provider (Google).</p>
    <p>For more details on how Google retains data, please consult Google's privacy policy (see the link provided in Section 3 of this policy) and specific data retention policies for its relevant products.</p>

    <h2>12. App Permissions Description</h2>
    <p>To ensure the functioning of advertising services and basic features, this application may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network access permission: Used for loading ads and verifying services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permission requests will follow standard operating system procedures and require user authorization, and will not be used for purposes unrelated to the core functions of the game.</p>

    <h2>13. Business Transfers</h2>
    <p>If the Project undergoes a business transfer such as a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, Your Personal Data may be transferred as part of the transferred assets. I will make efforts to ensure that the new entity continues to protect and process Your Personal Data in accordance with this policy or provides you with a new privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may revise this policy based on product feature updates, changes in third-party services used, or adjustments in laws and regulations. The revised version will be effective when posted on this page. I encourage users to periodically review this page for the latest changes.</p>
